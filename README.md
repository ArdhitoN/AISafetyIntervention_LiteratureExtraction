# AISafetyIntervention_LiteratureExtraction

This repository contains all outcomes created in the 2025 Eleuther AI Summer of Open AI Research program for project #5, Scientific Literature Knowledge Extraction Tool.

## Possible follow up projects (given a Knowledge Graph)

- Automated Discovery of Emerging Research Fronts and "Invisible Colleges": identify clusters of papers that are conceptually related, even if they don't cite each other directly
- Knowledge Gap Detection and Research Opportunity Mapping: identify weakly connected or isolated concepts, then prioritize them as potential research frontiers
- Consensus / Controversy Atlas (claim-level meta-analysis): aggregate by concept and time to generate consensus scores and timelines

Also other projects that should already be possible with a citation graph:

- Cross-Disciplinary Concept Bridging Tool: take the most influential concepts in one subgraph and combine them with concepts from another subgraph (transformers in protein folding)
- Concept Evolution and Trend Forecasting
